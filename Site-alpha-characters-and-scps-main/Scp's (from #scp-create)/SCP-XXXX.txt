Description:
    SCP-XXXX-1 is a small humanoid creature approximately 2 meters tall. SCP-XXXX-1 can be seen wearing a ring, that consists of an unknown material, however, destruction of this object has proven possible. SCP-XXXX-1 can use this ring, designated SCP-XXXX-2, to teleport anywhere it has been or can see visually. Currently, if a ring is destroyed, SCP-XXXX-1 can produce a new ring in a couple of hours. Currently, when SCP-XXXX-1 produces a new ring, it appears in a 3 meter radius around SCP-XXXX-1. If SCP-XXXX-1 is unable to find SCP-XXXX-2 within 4 minutes, a security team should be sent in to help find SCP-XXXX-2. If another 4 minutes pass, the Site is being contained and should be placed in lockdown and all administrative personnel are to be evacuated as SCP-XXXX-1 seems to go into a rage.
    When SCP-XXXX-1 goes into a rage, he begins rapidly teleporting to locations he has previously been to as well as new locations he discovers. During this, SCP-XXXX-1 will try its best to target high authorization personnel for an unknown reason. After around 3-5 minutes of this fit, SCP-XXXX-2 will appear on SCP-XXXX-1s' finger whether or not SCP-XXXX-1 put it on themselves or not.
